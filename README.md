## An AI chatbot for course selection in Minerva Schools @ KGI written in Python and Pyswip- a prolog python framework

This application was built in a bid to ease the pain of students in lower classes of the school, especially with regards to figuring out courses and their prerequisites. It was built using Python and a Prolog-Python library called Pyswip. In the long run, the goal of the application was to receive input from users regarding preferences for majors and various other constraints, and have a rovide an output suggesting the best choice of a course to take given the constraints.
